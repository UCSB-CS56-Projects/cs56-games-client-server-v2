List of potential issues to add:
1. [Add J-unit testing (100 points)](https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-client-server-v2/issues/19)
   -> For games
   -> Also for the server - client interaction


2. [Cleanup the interaction between Server & Client (200-300 points)](https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-client-server-v2/issues/20)
   -> The code works great, however, its not easy to understand
   -> After talking with our TA Kevin, he thought some of the interactions between client and server were "clever" but could be handled better.

3. [A leader board of each session of gaming. (100 points)](https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-client-server-v2/issues/21)
   -> Keeps track of wins and losses for each session
   -> When the terminal is exited and restarted, the leaderboard is restarted

4. [Update the GUI (200 points)](https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-client-server-v2/issues/22)
	-> change all java swing to fx, make as close to original as possible
   -> Right now we are using old Java Graphics
   -> A better implementation would be to utilize JavaFX

//Refurbished existing issues
5. [Further improving Javadoc (50 points)](https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-client-server-v2/issues/23)
6. Add Chess game (300-350 points)
