(Part a) 
The client server is used to host and direct games and regulate the next upcoming game in the lobby. As of right now, it only supports one game at a time.

(Part b) 
As a player waiting in the lobby, I can choose to spectate a game if a current game is already in play. I, as a player, have choices of some games which I can play but I wish there was more available choices to play as well as having multiple games running at once.

(Part c) 
compile:
    [javac] /fs/student/david_roster/cs56/cs56-games-client-server-v2/build.xml:34: warning: 'includeantruntime' was not set, defaulting to build.sysclasspath=last; set to false for repeatable builds

run:
BUILD FAILED
Target "run" does not exist in the project "null". 

test:
Buildfile: /fs/student/david_roster/cs56/cs56-games-client-server-v2/build.xml

BUILD FAILED
Target "test" does not exist in the project "null". 

Compiling works fine however it gives us a warning which makes sense why its not able to run. I believe this is because we are using the wrong commands. Our menotor Sean said its run and that the code is pretty sweet so we'll take his word for it. But until we learn what we are doing wrong, it is not workking for us using the ant commands we have learned.

EDIT FOR PART C:
So we just talked to sean(mentor) and we were using the wrong commands. The ones in the build.xml file are ant client-server and ant run-client. After doing those we were able to get the code running on one computer. However, we can only run the program on one computer right now.


(Part d)
1. As a spectator, I can watch multiple games at the same time so I can see all my friends playing.
2. As a spectator, I want to have a message board so I can chat with players in my lobby
3. As a player, I want to have tournament style games so I can see who is the best player.
4. AS a player, I want a game rankings that says who has the most wins so I know I'm the best.

(Part e)
The READme doesn't specify the "about" part of this code. By not specifying how to navigate it or use it, it makes future programmers lives more difficult in understanding to be able to make changes. The READme is also very short and not desciptive at all. It contains one sentence with no project history. This can easily be improved substantially.

(Part f)
There are hardly any description attributes in the build.xmls targets. As a result, *ant -p* only returns 1 target. Until we fix this, our build.xml file is going to have trouble. There isn't really any old legacy code that needs to be removed, just need to enhance the already existing code and make some minor modifications.

(Part g)
I believe the chess game addition was counted twice in the issues, but we are still around about 900 points and we have plenty of ideas that we can bring to Conrad's attention for possible point consideration. As logn as we work hard and dilligently, we will be fine. Issues are mostly clear, but talking to our mentor Sean will clear up any possible confusion we might have.

(Part h)
Right now, we have not found any other issues besides the ones stated in the ISSUES section on github. We have come up with some enhancements stated above such as: message board and multiple spectating of gamesby players.

(Part i) 
The organization of the codes is clear. They are well formatted and easy to read. There are plenty comments for explanation. The entirety of the code can be hard to go through because of the excess of directories present. The classes are able to be told whom relates to who by the comments at the begining of the code as well as the clean structure. If I had to catch a programmer up, I would show him the READme after we fix it since the one we have right now is lackluster.

Some issues are the huge amounts of code in javaclient.java, which needs to get refactored, Hndling messages and data could be simpler and some of the classes could be made more simpler.

Also will have to refactor for javaserver as well. The clientmodel class is very good.

(Part j)
I did not see any JUnit tests available or any other test coverage of that kind. THat is one big thing we will need to implement to validate that not only our whole code works as a whole, but that each method delievers the results we expect. To expand the test coverage, i would make a separate directory labeling each directory with the appropiate test classes in them.
